### My own simple Unix shell in C

###### What I used: C

A university project for Operating Systems. It's a simple Unix shell written in C. It prompts the user with username, current directory and a '$', then it waits for commands and executes them. I had to write my own implementations of 'exit', 'cd', 'rm', 'echo' and 'help' commands. For added bonus I changed the color of some elements of the shell.
